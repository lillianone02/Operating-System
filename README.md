# Operating-System Thread Management 
## Motivation 
Two processes run at the same time.  
In mutiprogramming systen, the two processes run concurrently.  
Therefore, the result may be out of control.  
Now we have the source code from nachos-4.0/code/test/test1.c and nachos-4.0/code/test/test2.c.  
We should adjust the source code to guarantee the result to be accurate.
